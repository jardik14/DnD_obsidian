# Potion of Growth
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  



When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [enlarge/reduce](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell for `1d4` hours (no [concentration](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
