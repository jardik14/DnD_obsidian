# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/ring-of-free-action.webp#right)


While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be [paralyzed](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
