*Weapon ([dagger](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/dagger.md)), major, rare*  
![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/dagger-of-venom.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d4 piercing
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `2d10` poison damage and become [poisoned](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
