# Medallion of Thoughts

![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/medallion-of-thoughts.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the [detect thoughts](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
