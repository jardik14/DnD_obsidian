# Mace of Terror
*Weapon ([mace](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/mace.md)), major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/mace-of-terror.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d6 bludgeoning
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. While it is [frightened](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action it can use only the [Dash](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/actions.md#Dash) action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the [Dodge](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/actions.md#Dodge) action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The mace regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
