# Shield of Missile Attraction
*Armor ([shield](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/shield.md)), cursed item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/shield-of-missile-attraction.webp#right)

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [Cursed](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

## Curse

This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
