These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to cold damage.  
- You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.  
- You can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees Fahrenheit.
