# Staff of Frost
*Staff, weapon, major, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/staff-of-frost.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [cone of cold](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold.md) (5 charges), [fog cloud](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md) (1 charge), [ice storm](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/ice-storm.md) (4 charges), or [wall of ice](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/wall-of-ice.md) (4 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
