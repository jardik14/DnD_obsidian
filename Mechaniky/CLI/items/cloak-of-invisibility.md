# Cloak of Invisibility
*Wondrous item, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/cloak-of-invisibility.webp#right)


While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over your head to cause yourself to become [invisible](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible). While you are [invisible](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible), anything you are carrying or wearing is [invisible](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) with you. You become visible when you cease wearing the hood. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

Deduct the time you are invisible, in increments of 1 minute, from the cloak's maximum duration of 2 hours. After 2 hours of use, the cloak ceases to function. For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the cloak goes unused, it regains 1 hour of duration.
