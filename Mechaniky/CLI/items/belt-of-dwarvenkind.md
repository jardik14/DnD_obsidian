# Belt of Dwarvenkind
*Wondrous item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/belt-of-dwarvenkind.webp#right)


While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:

- Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.  
- You have advantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks made to interact with dwarves.  

In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you're capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.

If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:

- You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.  
- You have [darkvision](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.  
- You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.
