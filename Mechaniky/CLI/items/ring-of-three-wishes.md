# Ring of Three Wishes
*Ring, major, legendary*  
![](/Mechaniky/CLI/items/img/ring-of-three-wishes.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the [wish](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.
