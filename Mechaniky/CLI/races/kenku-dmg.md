### Ambusher

In the first round of a combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against any creature who is [surprised](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised).

### Mimicry

You can mimic any sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

### Languages

You can read and write Common and Auran, but you can only speak using your Mimicry trait.
