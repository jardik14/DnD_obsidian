# Grappler
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 167. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

**Prerequisite**: Strength 13 or higher

You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.  
- You can use your action to try to pin a creature [grappled](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until the grapple ends.
