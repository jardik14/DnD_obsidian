      \ +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
      \ requiring no material components:\n\n**At will:** [create or destroy water](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md),\

    "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
  - "desc": "The marid can breathe air and water."
    "name": "Amphibious"
  - "desc": "If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam,\
      \ leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying."
    "name": "Elemental Demise"
  - "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the\
      \ most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular\
      \ genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that\
      \ isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant\
      \ wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates\
      \ that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature\
      \ only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature\
      \ within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then\
      \ cast the [wish](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell on the creature's behalf\
      \ to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might\
      \ try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.\
      \ The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

    "name": "Trident"
  - "desc": "The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide.\
      \ Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a\
      \ failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or\
      \ smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked [prone](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
