  - "desc": "The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17,\
      \ +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
      \ requiring no material components:\n\n**At will:** [detect evil and good](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
      \ [detect magic](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [thunderwave](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/thunderwave.md),\
      \ [disguise self](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) (often with a longer\
      \ duration than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)\n\n**3/day each:**\
      \ [create food and water](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/create-food-and-water.md) (can\
      \ create wine instead of water), [tongues](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/tongues.md),\
      \ [wind walk](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/wind-walk.md), [true polymorph](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
      \ (mightier genies only; see Disguises)\n\n**1/day each:** [conjure elemental](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md)\

  - "desc": "If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving\
      \ behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying."
    "name": "Elemental Demise"
  - "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
      \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md)\
      \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell.\
      \ Mightier genies can cast the [true polymorph](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
      \ spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal.\
      \ Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell\
      \ on other creatures and objects as well."

"actions":
  - "desc": "The djinni makes three scimitar attacks."
    "name": "Multiattack"
  - "desc": "*Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12\
      \ (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's\
      \ choice)."
    "name": "Scimitar"
  - "desc": "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms\
      \ on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as\
      \ long as the djinni maintains [concentration](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ (as if [concentrating](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on\
      \ a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed\
      \ on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures\
      \ [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the whirlwind\
      \ move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\n\nA creature\
      \ can use its action to free a creature [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.\
      \ If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
