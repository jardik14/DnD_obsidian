      \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md)\
      \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell.\
      \ Mightier genies can cast the [true polymorph](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
      \ spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal.\
