  - "desc": "The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17,\
      \ +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
      \ requiring no material components:\n\n**At will:** [detect evil and good](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
      \ [detect magic](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [thunderwave](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/thunderwave.md)\n\

  - "desc": "If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving\
      \ behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying."
    "name": "Elemental Demise"
  - "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the\
      \ most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular\
      \ genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that\
      \ isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant\
      \ wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates\
      \ that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature\
      \ only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature\
      \ within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then\
      \ cast the [wish](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell on the creature's behalf\
      \ to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might\
      \ try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.\
      \ The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

      \ choice)."
    "name": "Scimitar"
  - "desc": "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms\
      \ on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as\
      \ long as the djinni maintains [concentration](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ (as if [concentrating](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on\
      \ a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed\
      \ on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures\
      \ [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the whirlwind\
      \ move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\n\nA creature\
      \ can use its action to free a creature [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.\
      \ If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
