  - "desc": "The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14,\
      \ +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
      \ requiring no material components:\n\n**At will:** [detect evil and good](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
      \ [detect magic](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [stone shape](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md)\n\

    "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
  - "desc": "The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While\
      \ doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through."

      \ effects that would knock it [prone](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
    "name": "Sure-Footed"
  - "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the\
      \ most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular\
      \ genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that\
      \ isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant\
      \ wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates\
      \ that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature\
      \ only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature\
      \ within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then\
      \ cast the [wish](/Mechaniky/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell on the creature's behalf\
      \ to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might\
      \ try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.\
      \ The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."
