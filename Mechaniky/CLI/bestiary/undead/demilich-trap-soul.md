      \ of the demilich that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution\
      \ saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. On a successful save, the creature is\

      \ cease to exist. On a successful save, the target takes 24 (7d6) necrotic damage,\
      \ and if this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its soul is trapped\
      \ as if it failed the saving throw. A soul trapped in a gem for 24 hours is\
      \ devoured and ceases to exist.\n\nIf the demilich drops to 0 hit points, it\
      \ is destroyed and turns to powder, leaving behind its gems. Crushing a gem\
      \ releases any soul trapped within, at which point the target's body re-forms\
      \ in an unoccupied space nearest to the gem and in the same state as when it\
      \ was trapped."
