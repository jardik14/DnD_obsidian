The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra `1d6` psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.
