# Ensnaring Strike
*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

While [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by this spell, the target takes `1d6` piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin (Oath of the Ancients)](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-the-ancients.md); [Ranger](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md)
