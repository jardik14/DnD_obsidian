# Flame Blade
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (leaf of sumac)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes `3d6` fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for every two slot levels above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md)
