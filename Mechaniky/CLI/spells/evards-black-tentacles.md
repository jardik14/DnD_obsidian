# Evard's Black Tentacles
*4th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `3d6` bludgeoning damage and be [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the tentacles takes `3d6` bludgeoning damage.

A creature [restrained](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
