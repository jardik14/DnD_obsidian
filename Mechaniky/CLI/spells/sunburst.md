# Sunburst
*8th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `12d6` radiant damage and is [blinded](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature [blinded](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](/Mechaniky/CLI/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded).

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Wizard](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
