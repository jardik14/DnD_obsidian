# Wall of Fire
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `5d8` fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals `5d8` fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 4th.
