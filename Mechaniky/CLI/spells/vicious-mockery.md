# Vicious Mockery
*cantrip, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `1d4` psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

This spell's damage increases by `1d4` when you reach 5th level (`2d4`), 11th level (`3d4`), and 17th level (`4d4`).

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/Mechaniky/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
